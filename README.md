# Dog-and-Cat-Classification-using-CNN
The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. The CNN model will be trained on a dataset containing labeled images of dogs and cats, and it will learn to distinguish between the two animal classes.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image classification tasks. They are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. CNNs are known for their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from images, making them well-suited for tasks such as object recognition.

To start the project, you will need a dataset of images of dogs and cats. This dataset can be obtained from various sources, such as public datasets or online image repositories. Make sure the dataset is properly separate folders or tags for dog and cat images, For train dataset we have each 4000 images of dogs and cats. For test dataset we have each 1000 images of dogs and cats.

we evaluate the performance of the CNN model using the testing set. Calculate accuracy to assess how well the model is able to classify the images
